Please cite the aforementioned manuscript if using the code in this repository.

## Installation instructions

We provide a single docker container `ghcr.io/methods-group/proximalgalerkin` from [Proximal Galerkin Docker container registry](https://github.com/METHODS-Group/ProximalGalerkin/pkgs/container/proximalgalerkin) that provides an installation of all dependencies used in the examples of this paper.

One can start the image with 
```bash
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/root/shared --name=proximal-examples ghcr.io/methods-group/proximalgalerkin:dokken-combined_env
```
This shares the current directory with the docker container under the location `/root/shared`.
To restart this container at a later instance call
```bash
docker container start -i proxmial-examples
```

Within this installation you find all examples under `/root/LVPP`.

### MFEM
When wanting to run [MFEM](https://mfem.org/)-examples, one has to navigate to
 `/root/LVPP/mfem/examples` and call `make name_of_example` to compile the corresponding demo.

The MFEM scripts from this paper are already placed in this location in the container.

### FEniCS/Firedrake compatibility
FEniCS and Firedrake are installed in separate virtual environments within the container.
At launch, the user gets to use `FEniCS` by default.
To change to `Firedrake`, call
```bash
source firedrake-mode
```
To change back to `FEniCS` call
```bash
source dolfinx-mode
```

## Example 10: Linear Equality Constraints

Note that there is no numerical example for this setting because the derived variational formulation is equivalent to the standard Lagrange multiplier formulation for this class of problems.
